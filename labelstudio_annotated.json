coming up heads 1 and 1p of coming up tails 0 we can either predict p a continuous value between 0 and 1 or we can predict the outcome itself which is in 01 the former is regression the latter is classification logistic regression predicts that probability p and logistic classification takes that probability and uses a cutoff sometimes but not always 05 to predict the outcome many times the

taking a few online ml tutorials and have a text book not related to the course and i have to say that it is very similar to what i did in econometric with regards to predicting the regression analysis in ml is the same as i did in econometric but i just i didnt use python to do it i was using stata but you could use r to do the same thing and now days im sure they are teaching python in economics at any rate even after taking econometrics and taking a ml course i still find it hard to use this knowledge for anything specific or maybe more aptly how to apply this knowledge to anything useful albeit i do recognize that ml is a large topic and the first part of learning ml that i am doing including the textbook all start off doing regression analysis and maybe that is what everyone doesnt use when they talk about ml and the other parts i have yet to get to like ai and neural networks is all the rage that everyone is talking about idk i often hear people say that ml is used for large datasets like at netflix google amazon or etc to help suggest something or something along those lines well thats all fine and good but i dont work at a company like netflix or google in terms of having that much data or that level of skill the other problem is that to use ml at such companies is not really covered as they simple will say in the textbook or ml course that it is very complicated and wont go into thus kind of making the example of these fang companies almost useless in the short term and medium term when you learn about ml you often will be taught forecasting and you will be able to display it on a nice chartgraph with a line through it eg the trend line technically you could use excel to reproduce some of the things i have learned in ml so at times feels kind of pointless and demotivating or other things in ml like predict a single element if you have data on peoples age salary and whether or not they bought a car you can then ask your data if someone at 30 years old and that makes 70k will they buy a car it will be based off a percentage of course but it will come out as a 1 or 0 indicating they bought it or not the problem is normally at the end of all these tutorials the instructor will say something like the data you see in real life will never look like this and say this is for educational purposes and real life application is much harder as it has more variables etc so it becomes hard to do your own projects in ml because they dont really explain what variables you should be including or looking at for your own projects most of the time the ml tutorials focuses on how to do the predicationtrend line and not care how you got the data and what data items you should be using they just give you datasets from a website or make their own dataset this is a huge issue if you want to try doing ml on your own data because they dont teach you what data you should be capturing or what practical purposes you could use this for on a smaller scale such as a smallmedium business or say your website has x amount of traffic etc im often left wondering how the ml regression analysis chart that has a slope and line of best fit will be used in anything that they mention such as the things they say at the start of the chapter for example in my book they talk about using ml to create a spam filter and then you start off at the basics of learning about linear regression or they talk about using housing price data to predict how expensive a house will be based off like 57 factors but to be honest the housing sample is a great example but i often have trouble trying to think of a problem that i could create using ml to predict a result ie my own project also the examples often are intuitive like yeah the bigger a house the more expensive its going to be i dont even need data or run ml on it to know that it can get demotiving at times so the examples are illustrator of basically what you already know to be true like predicting gas prices will be higher in the summer time because more people drive because of more people take vacationtravel during summer also they never mention how to implement that line graph into an application like the mentioned spam filter its 200 pages like that countless hours of videos from tutorials saying now of course the real life data will not look anything like this but you get the idea i am kind of stuck inbetween smashing my head against the wall listening to the instructor on how a graph with a slope is ml and hoping that the next item they teach will get me to what i want im tempted to skip 20 hours or 200 pages ahead and dive into the neural networks but cant stop thinking that maybe regression analysis is going to be required or some of the tricks you are suppose to learn along the way will be helpful in the ai section or whatever so far its like learning basic statistics but in python"},"meta":{"id":"18362","strategy":"entropy","confidence":10.689407845789104},"created_at":"2025-05-06T16:35:27.218303Z","updated_at":"2025-05-06T16:38:08.198655Z","inner_id":288,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":11,"updated_by":11,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":5994,"annotations":[{"id":727,"completed_by":11,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"XJNExcxrlf","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"my_text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-05-06T16:38:11.398663Z","updated_at":"2025-05-06T16:38:11.398698Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.018,"prediction":{},"result_count":1,"unique_id":"4f03c83b-fed3-4491-bf5b-c42a5073472c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":5994,"project":11,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"amazing

found this very interesting and as someone with adhdi i had a lot of hyperfocused thoughts about it it brought up so many points of interest with in each of these is the fact that education was built upon the industrial revolution adhd is considered an epidemic of our time and our factory type of education destroys or ability for divergent thinking from the start of the industrial revolution the idea became that people should work in factories and large businesses as time went on this idea continued but in a different way by the 1920s there was a drive towards raising the standards of living people were encouraged overtime to get out of the cities where they worked and live in the suburbs in a house get married and join a standard stereotype where the women stayed home to raise to raise their children and the men went to work hopefully using the education they gained to obtain this idealistic life style but like he said in the talk this type of trend doesnt work anymore styles of life are so divergent and its obvious that not everyone can get a high paying job resulting from higher education and all women arent going to be stay at home moms and many cant actually during the 60s many women questioned their identities and blamed their education for giving them delusions of using their education later in life and as we see today many people are educated for a different experience than the one they will actually be living as for adhd it most certainly exists but is caught up in the confusion of our factory like education and the experience of being a distracted average child i believe adhd is both a cause and symptom of behavior but not always both take your eyes for example you get your eyes tested at a young age because your having trouble seeing clearly so you get prescription lenses you now wear these lenses for the rest of your life and often have to upgrade to a stronger prescription and no one asks why no one asks why are you like this how did it happen or if they do they say your genetically predisposed to it yes and no you can be genetically predisposed to be more likely to develop many types of conditions but it depends on the right or wrong conditions being met becoming near sighted or far sighted for instance is determined on three factors your nutrition your genetics and your life style actually some people have totally reversed their bad eye sight by changing their diet and their habits for instance a child who stays inside all day watching tv and playing videogames for hours refuses to eat his vegetables and whos parents or relatives have had glasses may develope near sightedness so in relation a child who has been mentally watching tv and playing videogames all day not spending any time practicing how to use their creativity exploring their real world developing interests in things that are natural and not directly stimulating interacting socially with others around them making constant decisions based on logic real feelings and experiences and most importantly practicing natural real motivation skills in combination with poor nutrition and specific genetics will very likely not develope mentally in the healthiest manner and it doesnt just go for adhd this could be a cause for any mental disability or difficulty in varying degrees of course but it is believed that behavior in any form is partially learned and partially developed and by developed i mean the way your brain developed how your nutrition and your experience shaped the way your brain works going back to education you can see why this factory mind set cant work for everyone as well as when you compair the standard disaplines of our modern education with the arts you find contradiction most people dont understand the arts most people wonder how the arts became so chaotic to the point it doesnt make sense anymore truth is that area of education evolved but only by those who pursue it would understand a big part of the confusion is this idea of perfection that envelopes the academic world the a grade is the pinacle of that idea do perfectly in your education and you get an a well this doesnt really work in the art world you still get graded when you do your work and do it well but school is for practicing the academics in art you study academics as well like art history art theory and your use of a medium like drawing or painting what you dont get graded on is on the things that cant be measured like your idea your creativity and the value of your work though in some cases your graded on how well you show a specific idea or use a specific skill but when it comes right down to it art isnt about any of this or it can be about all of it it can be about how others value your work it can be about how divergent your work seems to be it can be about how well your work matches a subject it can be about how well you use methods of design it can be about what kind of thoughts or feeling it brings up in people and it can be about how it compairs and is judged among a group of people who hold a specific adjenda or opinion in matters that are or are not artistic or intrinsic aka art competition or auction so in a way it is chaotic to the point people cant make sense of it any more but it is not inherently measurable and perfected it is the product of ideas and ideas are valued above all else and yet in education art is set in a lower bar of importance in all its forms and is confused with this idea of perfection and

taking a few online ml tutorials and have a text book not related to the course and i have to say that it is very similar to what i did in econometric with regards to predicting the regression analysis in ml is the same as i did in econometric but i just i didnt use python to do it i was using stata but you could use r to do the same thing and now days im sure they are teaching python in economics at any rate even after taking econometrics and taking a ml course i still find it hard to use this knowledge for anything specific or maybe more aptly how to apply this knowledge to anything useful albeit i do recognize that ml is a large topic and the first part of learning ml that i am doing including the textbook all start off doing regression analysis and maybe that is what everyone doesnt use when they talk about ml and the other parts i have yet to get to like ai and neural networks is all the rage that everyone is talking about idk i often hear people say that ml is used for large datasets like at netflix google amazon or etc to help suggest something or something along those lines well thats all fine and good but i dont work at a company like netflix or google in terms of having that much data or that level of skill the other problem is that to use ml at such companies is not really covered as they simple will say in the textbook or ml course that it is very complicated and wont go into thus kind of making the example of these fang companies almost useless in the short term and medium term when you learn about ml you often will be taught forecasting and you will be able to display it on a nice chartgraph with a line through it eg the trend line technically you could use excel to reproduce some of the things i have learned in ml so at times feels kind of pointless and demotivating or other things in ml like predict a single element if you have data on peoples age salary and whether or not they bought a car you can then ask your data if someone at 30 years old and that makes 70k will they buy a car it will be based off a percentage of course but it will come out as a 1 or 0 indicating they bought it or not the problem is normally at the end of all these tutorials the instructor will say something like the data you see in real life will never look like this and say this is for educational purposes and real life application is much harder as it has more variables etc so it becomes hard to do your own projects in ml because they dont really explain what variables you should be including or looking at for your own projects most of the time the ml tutorials focuses on how to do the predicationtrend line and not care how you got the data and what data items you should be using they just give you datasets from a website or make their own dataset this is a huge issue if you want to try doing ml on your own data because they dont teach you what data you should be capturing or what practical purposes you could use this for on a smaller scale such as a smallmedium business or say your website has x amount of traffic etc im often left wondering how the ml regression analysis chart that has a slope and line of best fit will be used in anything that they mention such as the things they say at the start of the chapter for example in my book they talk about using ml to create a spam filter and then you start off at the basics of learning about linear regression or they talk about using housing price data to predict how expensive a house will be based off like 57 factors but to be honest the housing sample is a great example but i often have trouble trying to think of a problem that i could create using ml to predict a result ie my own project also the examples often are intuitive like yeah the bigger a house the more expensive its going to be i dont even need data or run ml on it to know that it can get demotiving at times so the examples are illustrator of basically what you already know to be true like predicting gas prices will be higher in the summer time because more people drive because of more people take vacationtravel during summer also they never mention how to implement that line graph into an application like the mentioned spam filter its 200 pages like that countless hours of videos from tutorials saying now of course the real life data will not look anything like this but you get the idea i am kind of stuck inbetween smashing my head against the wall listening to the instructor on how a graph with a slope is ml and hoping that the next item they teach will get me to what i want im tempted to skip 20 hours or 200 pages ahead and dive into the neural networks but cant stop thinking that maybe regression analysis is going to be required or some of the tricks you are suppose to learn along the way will be helpful in the ai section or whatever so far its like learning basic statistics but in python"},"meta":{"id":"18362","strategy":"entropy","confidence":10.689407845789104},"created_at":"2025-05-06T16:41:58.715749Z","updated_at":"2025-05-06T16:43:43.308900Z","inner_id":318,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":11,"updated_by":11,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6024,"annotations":[{"id":757,"completed_by":11,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"jmOggs1efg","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"my_text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-05-06T16:43:46.016085Z","updated_at":"2025-05-06T16:43:46.016113Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":1.703,"prediction":{},"result_count":1,"unique_id":"a33feab9-78e7-40e4-919c-30eb4a8d079f","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":6024,"project":11,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"amazing

found this very interesting and as someone with adhdi i had a lot of hyperfocused thoughts about it it brought up so many points of interest with in each of these is the fact that education was built upon the industrial revolution adhd is considered an epidemic of our time and our factory type of education destroys or ability for divergent thinking from the start of the industrial revolution the idea became that people should work in factories and large businesses as time went on this idea continued but in a different way by the 1920s there was a drive towards raising the standards of living people were encouraged overtime to get out of the cities where they worked and live in the suburbs in a house get married and join a standard stereotype where the women stayed home to raise to raise their children and the men went to work hopefully using the education they gained to obtain this idealistic life style but like he said in the talk this type of trend doesnt work anymore styles of life are so divergent and its obvious that not everyone can get a high paying job resulting from higher education and all women arent going to be stay at home moms and many cant actually during the 60s many women questioned their identities and blamed their education for giving them delusions of using their education later in life and as we see today many people are educated for a different experience than the one they will actually be living as for adhd it most certainly exists but is caught up in the confusion of our factory like education and the experience of being a distracted average child i believe adhd is both a cause and symptom of behavior but not always both take your eyes for example you get your eyes tested at a young age because your having trouble seeing clearly so you get prescription lenses you now wear these lenses for the rest of your life and often have to upgrade to a stronger prescription and no one asks why no one asks why are you like this how did it happen or if they do they say your genetically predisposed to it yes and no you can be genetically predisposed to be more likely to develop many types of conditions but it depends on the right or wrong conditions being met becoming near sighted or far sighted for instance is determined on three factors your nutrition your genetics and your life style actually some people have totally reversed their bad eye sight by changing their diet and their habits for instance a child who stays inside all day watching tv and playing videogames for hours refuses to eat his vegetables and whos parents or relatives have had glasses may develope near sightedness so in relation a child who has been mentally watching tv and playing videogames all day not spending any time practicing how to use their creativity exploring their real world developing interests in things that are natural and not directly stimulating interacting socially with others around them making constant decisions based on logic real feelings and experiences and most importantly practicing natural real motivation skills in combination with poor nutrition and specific genetics will very likely not develope mentally in the healthiest manner and it doesnt just go for adhd this could be a cause for any mental disability or difficulty in varying degrees of course but it is believed that behavior in any form is partially learned and partially developed and by developed i mean the way your brain developed how your nutrition and your experience shaped the way your brain works going back to education you can see why this factory mind set cant work for everyone as well as when you compair the standard disaplines of our modern education with the arts you find contradiction most people dont understand the arts most people wonder how the arts became so chaotic to the point it doesnt make sense anymore truth is that area of education evolved but only by those who pursue it would understand a big part of the confusion is this idea of perfection that envelopes the academic world the a grade is the pinacle of that idea do perfectly in your education and you get an a well this doesnt really work in the art world you still get graded when you do your work and do it well but school is for practicing the academics in art you study academics as well like art history art theory and your use of a medium like drawing or painting what you dont get graded on is on the things that cant be measured like your idea your creativity and the value of your work though in some cases your graded on how well you show a specific idea or use a specific skill but when it comes right down to it art isnt about any of this or it can be about all of it it can be about how others value your work it can be about how divergent your work seems to be it can be about how well your work matches a subject it can be about how well you use methods of design it can be about what kind of thoughts or feeling it brings up in people and it can be about how it compairs and is judged among a group of people who hold a specific adjenda or opinion in matters that are or are not artistic or intrinsic aka art competition or auction so in a way it is chaotic to the point people cant make sense of it any more but it is not inherently measurable and perfected it is the product of ideas and ideas are valued above all else and yet in education art is set in a lower bar of importance in all its forms and is confused with this idea of perfection and conformaty"},"meta":{"id":"11370","strategy":"entropy","confidence":12.131579799020434},"created_at":"2025-05-06T16:41:58.716523Z","updated_at":"2025-05-06T16:45:32.650463Z","inner_id":330,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":11,"updated_by":11,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6036,"annotations":[{"id":769,"completed_by":11,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"e17B38T_jg","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"my_text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-05-06T16:46:13.666100Z","updated_at":"2025-05-06T16:46:13.666127Z","draft_created_at":"2025-05-06T16:46:08.790326Z","lead_time":13.707,"prediction":{},"result_count":1,"unique_id":"45026285-337e-4abb-b2d0-85bb0a6f5431","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":6036,"project":11,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"hello

skeleton and make up the shoulder is made of two bones the scapula shoulder blade and clavicle collar bone with one running to the back and the other linking up at a socket in the sternum it means that we like all mammals can pivot our shoulders around not just the arms within the socket compare this to birdsreptiles and older tetrapod groups and youll find that the pectoral girdle is a fused mass just like the pelvic girdle with two bones at the front that firmly anchor the shoulders in place to the sternum this third bone is the coracoid bone and mammals lost it a long time ago except in monotremes on the plus though like the rigid flight frame of a bird it provides a very solid anchor for powerful forelimbs which is why platypus primarily use their forelimbs to swim or echidna to dig

the actual smallest so thats the second smallest let me put both of them first and second right now saving myself a relook i know computers are still faster in the end but i suspect thats because we physically cannot write or move objects around as quickly as a computer can physically write data and possibly our brain has a slower clock speed rather than computational efficiency anyone know if
